## Getting Started

This project uses `uv`. Installation instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/henri123lemoine/audiobook.git
    cd audiobook
    ```

2. Run the project! This should take care of installing dependencies, setting up the virtual environment, and running the project.
   ```bash
   uv run -m [file.path.no.ext]
   ```

## Development

To install development dependencies, run `uv pip install -r pyproject.toml --all-extras`.

To run tests, use `uv run pytest`.
